So far, I have completed the following:

Home Page: Includes two optionsâ€”"Create Quiz" and "Play Quiz".
Create Quiz Feature:

Users can select a category or add a new category dynamically.
If the category already exists, it cannot be added again.
Users can add a question with four unique answers and select the correct answer.
The system prevents duplicate questions in the same category.
After saving, the page reloads, and the user returns to the home page.

Next Step: Implementing Play Quiz

The "Play Quiz" button is present but not yet functional.
My next task is to display all available categories and allow users to select and play quizzes.
I will continue working on this and update you once the "Play Quiz" feature is ready.
